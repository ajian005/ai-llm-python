    Add and manage memory : https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/memory/add-memory/
  
    AI applications need memory to share context across multiple interactions. In LangGraph, you can add two types of memory:

    Add short-term memory as a part of your agent's state to enable multi-turn conversations.
    Add long-term memory to store user-specific or application-level data across sessions.

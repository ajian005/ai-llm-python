    Graph API How to use the graph API : https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/graph-api/

    This guide demonstrates the basics of LangGraph's Graph API. It walks through state, as well as composing common graph structures such as sequences, branches, and loops. 
    It also covers LangGraph's control features, including the Send API for map-reduce workflows and the Command API for combining state updates with "hops" across nodes.
